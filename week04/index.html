                <ol>
                    <li> A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another
                        object without using inheritance. It allows more complex objects to be created by
                        ‘mixing’ basic objects together. Isn't this just using other classes with a class?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Just a note in case other students have issues.
                        Chapter 15 Quiz Ninja was a booger. Could not get the webpack to build; after hours of
                        exercising my
                        google-fu, I found that to revert babel and webpack to a much earlier build. Yay! It would then
                        build - but the page wouldn't work. Tracked down that "hiScore" tag was missing from the HTML
                        (book says to copy your index.html and styles.css). Added that, then it worked! Time for a
                        vacation!
