                <h3>Question(s):</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In Google Chrome and Edge, the input displays before the page is rendered. It functions as
                        expected in Firefox. I've tried adding
                        async to the loading of the script, also tried adding a 'window.load' function with
                        'start(quiz)'. Nothing
                        seems to work. What is the proper method to handle inputs after a page is rendered? I've found
                        numerous solutions, many revolve around setting a timer- but this doesn't seem quite right.

                <ol>
                    <li> Sort(): Sorting values.. do they sort based on full value comparison - or by first letters
                        (like
                        numbers): Blue Widow, Black Widow. Black is 2nd in the list, but would it be placed as a first
                        item?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Function Hoisting: Hoisting is the JavaScript interpreterâ€™s action of moving all variable and
                        function
                        declarations to the top of the current scope, regardless of where they are defined.
                        Functions that are defined using a function declaration are automatically hoisted,
                        meaning they can be invoked before they have been defined.
                    </li>
                    <li>Lazy Evaluations: This is an awesome concept! I've been a C++ programmer for many years, and you
                        have to perform operator overload tricks to do this.</li>
